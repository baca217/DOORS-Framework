FUNCTION: download_song
INPUTS: songName (string)
FUNCTIONALITY: essentially takes in a song name or really string and plugs it into the youtube
search algorithm. There are 2 search results that are returned. For now we just take the first
one and pull the audio from that video using youtube-dl and ffmpeg. The audio is downloaded 
any format usually .webm or .mp4 but it's converted to a .wav file. That file is then downsampled
to 8000 samples, converted to mono if necessary and saved to "Song.wav". The old .wav file is removed
and the new sampled file is what's left.
